HTML5DomDoc
===========

Class for serving HTML via php DOMDocument

What This Class Does
--------------------

This class makes it a little easier to sever HTML content that exists as a
libxml2 DOMDocument class instance.

It only serves content as XML (intentionally) so Internet Explorer <= 8 users
are screwed, but I really do not give a damn about them. Sorry, I just do not.

The CSP stuff in it is very experimental.

Better README will come.

MIT license, just like the older version of this I have on phpclasses is.
